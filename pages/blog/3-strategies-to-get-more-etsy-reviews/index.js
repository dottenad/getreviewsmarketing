                <p className="mt-0">
                  When first starting out on Etsy, it can be hard to get
                  momentum. The sight of 0 reviews can be very defeating, and
                  could be what is causing low or no sales on your Etsy store.
                  This makes it all the more important to go above and beyond
                  with customer service once you do make a sale. Only once your
                  customers expectations of their purchase from your store have
                  been met can they begin to think about the overall experience
                  with your brand and your product. Your customer will take
                  everything into consideration when going to leave a review on
                  your store. Price, shipping time, quality, etc., so it is
                  important to make sure you tick all of these boxes to ensure
                  you get a good review from your customer. However, you could
                  have a perfect transaction with a customer, they could love
                  your product, and still not leave you a review. Why is that?
                  Most of the time, life takes precedence over leaving a review
                  on your product on Etsy. This doesn&apos;t mean they had a bad
                  experience, it just means they don&apos;t have the time to
                  leave you a review. So, how do you get this customer to leave
                  a review? Let us show you the top 3 tactics Etsy sellers are
                  using to generate product reviews on their Etsy store below.
                </p>
                <h2>1.) Request a review in your order confirmation email</h2>
                <p>
                  The confirmation email is what is sent to your customer
                  immediately after they place their order with you. Etsy allows
                  you to customize this email to say whatever you would like it
                  to say via the &quot;Message to Buyers&quot; feature. To
                  access your Message to Buyers feature, visit{" "}
                  <Link
                    href="https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/me?ref=seller-platform-mcnav"
                    passHref
                  >
                    <a target="_blank">this link</a>
                  </Link>{" "}
                  and search for the &quot;Message to Buyers&quot; text box (2nd
                  up from bottom at the time of this writing.) Here you can
                  automatically remind every customer to remember to leave you a
                  review. Here is a basic template you can use in this area
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      Thank you for your purchase! If you enjoyed your
                      experience with our store and our products, feel free to
                      leave us a review. We would really appreciate it!
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  While requesting a review in your order confirmation
                  doesn&apos;t necessarily yield the best conversion rate, it
                  does serve as an additional reminder for your customer to
                  leave their review that doesn&apos;t make since not to have
                  (especially since it&apos;s a free feature built into Etsy.)
                </p>
                <h2>2.) Offer a free gift on your insert cards</h2>
                <p>
                  An insert card is a slip of paper that you insert into the box
                  that you send to your customer. Insert cards can vary in size
                  depending on the size of your product, but typically range in
                  size from the size of a business card (2&quot; x 3.5&quot;) to
                  the size of a post card (5&quot; x 7&quot;). What an insert
                  card allows you to do is communicate a message to your
                  customer. This can be a simple &quot;Thank you for your
                  purchase!&quot; message, or in this case, the message that
                  you&apos;ll want to communicate on your insert card is an
                  offer for a free gift. Here is an example of how this looks:
                  <figure className="mt-4 mb-4">
                    <img
                      className="w-full rounded-lg shadow"
                      src="/_blog/3-strategies-to-get-more-etsy-reviews/insert.jpg"
                      alt=""
                    />{" "}
                  </figure>
                  When you customer opens their package, the first thing they
                  should see is this insert card. You may be asking, why would I
                  give my customer a free gift? What do I get out of it? This is
                  where our product,{" "}
                  <Link href="https://www.getreviews.ai/" passHref>
                    <a>GetReviews.ai</a>
                  </Link>{" "}
                  comes into play. GetReviews.ai facilitates the exchange of a
                  free gift for your customer&apos;s honest review on the
                  platform that they purchased your product from. Whereas
                  typically your customer would forget to leave you a review, a
                  free gift offering on an insert card in collaboration with a
                  GetReviews survey will greatly increase the likelihood that
                  your customer does leave you a review on the platform that
                  they purchased your product from. In this case, since your
                  customer purchased your product from Etsy, GetReviews will
                  collect their review via a survey hosted on GetReviews, and
                  request that they post their completed review to Etsy. Then,
                  once your customer has posted their review to Etsy, they will
                  be able to claim a free gift that you have designated for
                  them. This can be a product, coupon, or eGift card. The
                  possibilities are endless! This combination of an insert card
                  and GetReviews is a very effective way to generate more
                  reviews on your products on Etsy.
                </p>
                <h2>3.) Request a review in a follow up email</h2>
                <p>
                  When first starting out, it is important to go to great
                  lengths to ensure that your customer has a good experience
                  with your product. Follow up emails are a great way to do
                  this. Some may interpret follow-up emails as pestering the
                  customer, but if your intentions are pure, your customer will
                  notice this and engage. Once you have ensured that your
                  customer&apos;s experience has been nothing but the best (and
                  after correcting any issues they may have encountered), feel
                  free to ask them politely to provide a review on Etsy for the
                  product that they purchased from you. You can also use your
                  GetReviews.ai survey link here since GetReviews gives you a
                  survey URL that you can easily share, so including this survey
                  URL in your follow up email could also be a possibility.

                  I hope this post helped shine some light on the different
                  review generation methods used by top Etsy sellers. If you

                  GetReviews.ai, please feel free to send me a message. Thanks!
